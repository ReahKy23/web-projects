            “We won the championship for the first time. The team was excited–and don't get me wrong, so was I, but I
            don’t seem to feel like I belong anymore. I feel like Coach was just using me as a placeholder. I don’t feel
            that excitement anymore. Is soccer still for me?”

        <div id="boots" class="diary-entry">
            “OMG **angry face**!!!! Mom bought me stupid “BEARPAW” boots from PAYLESS, today. What the hell is BEARPAW?! These
                are bootleg UGGS **facepalm** ... They are pretty warm though **considering**”

            “How long can I leave this here before Grandma gets annoyed and washes them for me. But my favorite sweater
            is in there, all mixed up with Kahlil’s stinky socks. I NEEEEEED IT **sad face**. Please just wash it for me
                grandma”

        <div id="tapShoes" class="diary-entry">
            “Omg, I can’t believe they sell tap shows in a size 12. It’s been so long, I’ve missed dancing so much. But
            why are these kids so ahead of me? Has it really been that long? Am I losing my rhythm?!!!”
        </div> <br>
        <div id="cleats" class="diary-entry">
            “Mom put me in stinking soccer. I miss dance, so what if I spent most of the time in the locker room than in
            actual class…Oh crap here comes the ball…OMG I SCOREDDD!!... into the other team’s goal **awkward.**
        </div> <br>

        <div id="costume-2" class="diary-entry">
            “Ohhh my other dance costume. Oh this one is only a few years old…I should wear it for Halloween, free
            costume. **genius smirk**”

        <div id="dryer" class="diary-entry">
            “Score!! Here’s the standing dryer. WASH DAY was gruesome, I don't have the energy to dry my hair and my

        <div id="books" class="diary-entry">
            “Crap! It’s a shame the Salvation Army is permanently closed. I feel like these books are just moving into
            any available crevice in the house. First the bookshelf, then under my bed, now the closet…Oh Judy B. Jones,
            Classic”
